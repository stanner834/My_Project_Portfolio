# Detecting Discovery commands

We are going to review logs in Splunk based on our BAS testing of Discovery techniques from MITRE Caldera.&#x20;

One disvoery technique we would like to detect is identifying which antivirus software is running on a machine. An attacker can use this information to further disable and or evade detection of the antivirus.&#x20;

We can review the report generated by the red team in [Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS)](../../homelab/test-range/breach-and-attack-simulation-bas.md)

Using this information, we can head on over to our Splunk instance to see if we have any logs pertaining to the Discover antivirus programs technique.&#x20;

Looks like we have a couple Sysmon logs from our Windows machine, we can use this information to help us build a detection for this technique.
