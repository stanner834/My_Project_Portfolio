# Test range

Having a test range is incredibly important for learning and growing as a security practitioner. When I was a kid, I loved to snowboard, and we would go to the park every day. Eventually, we reached a point where we wanted to continue pushing our limits, so we built a park to experiment with in our backyard. In the backyard, you can try new tricks in a very controlled environment, allowing you to grow and learn. It gives you an opportunity to be curious and demonstrate your knowledge.
