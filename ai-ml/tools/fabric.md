# Fabric

I utilize a tool called "Fabric" by Daniel Miessler. It is the most useful AI tool I have seen to date and integrates very well into your personal life. I recommend giving it a try; there are tons of use cases for this tool.

The tool allows you to use "Patterns" or advanced prompts. These prompts are open-source and extremely well built. If you are trying to get a jump start into actually using AI, this is your perfect chance.
