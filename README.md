## About me

Hey there, I am Sam, a cybersecurity professional specializing in detection engineering. I am passionate about collaboration, solving complex problems, and philosophy.I have embarked on a journey of continuous learning and blogging about what I do. I have learned that to grow and solve complex challenges, we need to foster a community of collaboration, dedication, and a desire to protect what we have worked so hard to create. I hope this blog can serve as a stepping stone for others to learn more about growing as a cybersecurity professional, as many of these projects were the building blocks and foundation of my career.​
