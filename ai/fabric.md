# Fabric

I currently utilize a tool called "Fabric" by Daniel Miessler. It is the most useful AI tool I have seen to date, and works very well integrating into your personal life. I would recommend giving it a try, there are tons of use cases with this tool.&#x20;



The tool allows you to use "Patterns" or advanced prompts. These prompts are open source and extemely well built. If you are trying to get a jump start into actually using AI, this is your perfect chance/
