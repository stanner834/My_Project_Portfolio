# About me

Hey there, I am Sam, a Cybersecurity professional specializing in Detection Engineering. I am passionate about collaboration, solving complex problems, and philosophy.

I have embarked on a journey of continuous learning and blogging about what I do. I have learned that to grow and solve complex challenges, we need to foster a community of collaboration, dedication, and a desire to protect what we have worked so hard to create. I hope this blog can serve as a stepping stone for others to learn more about growing as a Cybersecurity professional, as many of these projects were the building blocks and foundation of my career.
