# Cloud Resume Challenge - AWS

## Overview

The Cloud Resume Project is a hands-on initiative designed to help individuals build and showcase their cloud computing skills through the creation of a professional resume website hosted on the cloud. This project provides a practical and tangible way for participants to demonstrate their expertise in cloud technologies and gain valuable experience in deploying and managing web applications.

## Features

* **Serverless Architecture:** Leverage serverless computing services like AWS Lambda to handle dynamic content generation, resulting in cost-effective and scalable solutions.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Utilize tools such as AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to define and provision cloud resources, allowing for easy replication and version control.
* **CI/CD Integration:** Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using services like AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process.
* **Content Delivery:** Utilize a content delivery network (CDN) such as Amazon CloudFront to optimize website performance and ensure low latency for users across the globe.
* **Databases and Storage:** Integrate cloud-based databases (e.g., Amazon DynamoDB) and storage solutions (e.g., Amazon S3) to store and retrieve data efficiently.
